      <p class="lead">Freelance Web Designer/Developer. Previously at IGS and UPN. Love Football and Video games!</p>

      <p>I'm a web designer/developer living and working in Leicester City. Previously I studied at Leicester College,
        and went to De Montfort University to study a degree in Computing. I extended my time at university and went on to
        doing a masters degree in the same field.</p>

        <p>Around that time, I've worked as a software developer for both United Pallet Network and most recently at IGS Solutions, where I utilised
        my skills in creating/maintaing web applications.</p>

        <p>On the side, I've been working as a freelance developer creating websites for local businesses across Leicester.</p>
